# VRCFTReceiver

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod, that let's you use [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking) Program for Eye and Face Tracking inside [Resonite](https://resonite.com/).

## Installation

1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [VRCFTReceiver.dll](https://github.com/hazre/VRCFTReceiver/releases/latest/download/VRCFTReceiver.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. `vrc-oscquery-lib.dll` and `MeaMod.DNS.dll` to rml_libs folder, you find it where resonite is installed.
4. Launch VRCFaceTracking
5. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.

## Requirements

- [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking) 5.2.3

## How it works

VRCFTReceiver automatically connects VRCFaceTracking to Resonite using OSC (Open Sound Control) communication and OSCQuery for automatic discovery. 

When you start Resonite with this mod installed, it:
1. **Automatically discovers VRCFaceTracking** - Uses OSCQuery to advertise itself as a VRChat-compatible client, no manual setup required
2. **Receives face tracking data** - Gets eye and face movement data in real-time over OSC (default port: 9000)  
3. **Translates to Resonite** - Converts the data into Resonite's native eye and face tracking format
4. **Handles avatar changes** - Automatically notifies VRCFaceTracking when you switch avatars

This provides seamless face tracking in Resonite without needing to configure JSON files or manually set up connections.
